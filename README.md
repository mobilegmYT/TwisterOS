# Twister OS Info

The biggest collection of information about Twister OS. Made by RPiNews#0816 on Discord. This is mostly used to just host downloads for Twister OS Lite since it's small enough it can fit in within GH size limits (if you want to upload 2gb file to github you'll need to upload to releases tab instead of as a file on the main repo and get GH pro.)
